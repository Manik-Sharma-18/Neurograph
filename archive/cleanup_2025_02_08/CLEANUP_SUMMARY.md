# NeuroGraph Redundancy Cleanup - February 8, 2025

## Summary
Cleaned up redundant legacy components that were superseded by modular implementations.

## Files Removed
1. `core/forward_engine.py` - Legacy forward engine (superseded by `core/modular_forward_engine.py`)
2. `core/cell.py` - Legacy PhaseCell (superseded by `core/modular_cell.py`)
3. `core/tables.py` - Legacy lookup tables (superseded by `core/high_res_tables.py`)
4. `modules/input_adapters.py` - Legacy PCA adapter (superseded by `modules/linear_input_adapter.py`)

## Critical Fix Applied
- Fixed import inconsistency in `core/propagation.py`:
  - Changed `from core.cell import PhaseCell` to `from core.modular_cell import ModularPhaseCell`
  - Updated type hints to match actual usage

## Impact Analysis
- **Production Code**: No impact - only used modular components
- **Archive Code**: All legacy usage is in `archive/experiments/` - preserved for historical reference
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced by removing unused components
- **Maintainability**: Improved by having single implementation per component

## Testing Results
- System tested before and after cleanup
- Functionality preserved (evaluation pipeline works identically)
- No performance regression observed

## Backup Location
All removed files backed up to: `archive/cleanup_2025_02_08/redundant_files/`

## Current Architecture
- **Input**: `modules/linear_input_adapter.py` (learnable linear projection, NO PCA)
- **Forward Engine**: `core/modular_forward_engine.py` (dynamic 2-25 timesteps)
- **Phase Cell**: `core/modular_cell.py` (current implementation)
- **Lookup Tables**: `core/high_res_tables.py` (high-resolution 32Ã—512)
- **Training**: `train/modular_train_context.py` (production system)

## Remaining Optimizations to Evaluate
- `core/vectorized_forward_engine.py` - GPU-optimized version (unused)
- `core/vectorized_propagation.py` - Vectorized propagation (unused)
- `core/vectorized_activation_table.py` - GPU activation table (unused)

These could provide performance benefits but require integration work.
