# Training Context Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document explains the cleanup of legacy training contexts in the NeuroGraph project, completed on 2025-01-27.

## Files Archived

### `train_context_legacy.py` (formerly `train/train_context.py`)
**Original Purpose**: Enhanced training context with activation balancing and multi-output loss support
**Architecture**: Function-based `enhanced_train_context()` implementation
**Key Features**:
- Batch processing with merged input contexts
- Activation frequency tracking and balancing
- Multi-output loss strategies
- Legacy PCA input adapters
- Extended lookup table modules
- Targets `config/default.yaml` configuration

**Reason for Archival**: Superseded by the modular training system

## Current Production System

### `train/modular_train_context.py` (ACTIVE)
**Purpose**: Production-ready modular training context
**Architecture**: Class-based `ModularTrainContext` implementation
**Key Features**:
- High-resolution lookup tables (64×1024)
- Gradient accumulation with √N scaling
- Linear projection input adapters
- Orthogonal class encodings with caching
- Intermediate node credit assignment (cosine similarity)
- Categorical cross-entropy loss
- 1000-node architecture support
- Targets `config/neurograph.yaml` configuration

## Analysis Results

### Usage Analysis
- **Production files** (main.py, train.py) exclusively use `ModularTrainContext`
- **Legacy system** only used in archived experimental files
- **No active dependencies** on the legacy training context

### Architecture Comparison
| Feature | Legacy (train_context.py) | Current (modular_train_context.py) |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Architecture | Function-based | Class-based |
| Resolution | Standard lookup tables | High-resolution (64×1024) |
| Input Processing | PCA adapters | Linear projection |
| Class Encoding | Basic encodings | Orthogonal with caching |
| Gradient System | Direct updates | Accumulation with scaling |
| Loss Function | MSE-based | Categorical cross-entropy |
| Node Scale | 50-node focused | 1000-node optimized |
| Credit Assignment | Output nodes only | All active nodes (intermediate) |

### Memory Bank Evidence
The project's memory bank confirms:
- Modular system is the validated, production-ready architecture
- Legacy system served its purpose during development evolution
- Current system includes recent enhancements (intermediate node credit assignment)
- Clean separation between production and experimental code

## Recommendation Implemented
**ARCHIVED** the legacy training context as it represents an earlier development phase that has been fully superseded by the modular system. The modular system provides:

1. **Better Architecture**: Class-based design with clear separation of concerns
2. **Enhanced Performance**: High-resolution computation and gradient accumulation
3. **Modern Features**: Orthogonal encodings, linear projection, intermediate credit assignment
4. **Production Readiness**: Full integration with 1000-node system and optimized radiation
5. **Maintainability**: Modular components with comprehensive configuration management

## Impact
- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed confusion between legacy and current systems
- **Developer Clarity**: Single, clear training context for all development
- **Maintenance Reduction**: No need to maintain parallel training systems
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Memory bank and documentation now reflect actual architecture

This cleanup ensures the NeuroGraph project has a clean, maintainable codebase focused on the production-ready modular training system.
